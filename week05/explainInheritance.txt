Inheritance in C# language is the possibility of a class to inherit or to take directly attributes and methods from another main class, without having to rewrite
everything, it directly takes the original class and uses the attributes and methods already there.
Inheritance helps the coder to save many hours of coding in big codes, and make it easier for him to create the new derived classes that contains only the new 
more specific new attributes, which means reusing the same code. For example we have 2 classes, the original (parent) class and the derived class (child), the parent here as an example is vehicle class, all
vehicles have all the attributes of every vehicle can have, then another class named TruckVehicle, and another one called SuvVehicle, both can take the attributes from  the 
vehicle class and specify the one that are not shared with any other vehicle.


from my code I had 3 classes, 2 of them are derived (child class) and on eis the parent, Assignment is the main class: 
public class Assignment
{
    private string _studentName;
    private string _topic;

    public Assignment(string studentName, string topic)
    {
        _studentName = studentName;
        _topic = topic;
    }
    ...

in the child class MathAssignment I dont have to get the student name and topic because they are already in the assignment class, all I need to do it to 
is to use a colon followed by the name of the parent class to inherit the attributes in the new class, and : base() if front of the MathAssinment() constructor in 
order to call the parent and take the attributes that they are in the parent:

public class MathAssignment : Assignment
{
    private string _textBookSection;
    private string _problems;

    public MathAssignment(string studentName, string topic, string textBookSection, string problems) : base(studentName, topic)
    {
        _textBookSection = textBookSection;
        _problems = problems;
    } ...

Encapsulation is the act of Making the code in a class as a capsule, which makes it hidden from other code, what happens in the capsule 
is only in the capsule, which means if something wrong happens inside it, the other code is not to blame.

when a class is encapsulated, this class only contains the data and the logic around this data, it's furthermore a good use of the classes.
with this logic, the other parts of the code when they need to perform any kind of task that this encapsulated class contains, they cannot
access directly the data but use the class and communicate with it so they can use the data appropriately without directly accessing it.

I will paste some of the code used in the class fraction as an example: 

here we set the data as private, which means it's encapsulated in the class Fraction.
public class Fraction
{
    private int _top;
    private int _bottom;
    ....
}

here we set fraction() method that we can use in our program to get the data.
public Fraction(int top, int bottom)
    {
        _top = top;
        _bottom = bottom;

    }

we can use it in the main program like this: 
Fraction f3 = new Fraction(6, 7);      // 6/7
Console.WriteLine($"fraction 3 is: {f3} (top = {f3.GetTop()}, bottom = {f3.GetBottom()})");

it will return a text like this: fraction 3 is: Fraction (top = 6, bottom = 7)

of course this is a simple explanation, and our team activity makes it more detailed and interesting.

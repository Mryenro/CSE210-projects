Abstraction means the process that we can use in programming that can simplifies ideas, making them simple means hiding unecessary
 details that can be found seperately in a class, and focus only on the important ideas only. An application of Abstraction can in real life
  for example when you use Python, using import Math library, you can use it to calculate the square root without knowing what happens behind
  the calculations 
  "import math

# Calculate the square root of a number
number = 25
square_root = math.sqrt(number)"

So I ask the program to use the sqrt property that allows me to calculate the square root of 25 without knowing how it happens in the background.


from the program I wrote, here is an Abstraction example: 
        Job job1 = new Job(); //first job
        job1._company = "Microsoft";
        job1._jobTitle = "Software Engineer";
        job1._startYear = 2027;
        job1._endYear = 2029;

Explanation: in this example I used Job class without knowing how it works internally, I just created an object (job1) from the class Job
and defined the properties of the class (_company, _jobTitle etc).
